# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

I built this app because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I really liked seeing them visualized! It provides visualizations for bubble, insertion, selection, quick, merge, and radix (2-bit LSD) sort. The user can vary the size and generation type for the array of numbers to sort, as well as control the speed of the sorting algorithms. It also displays the amount of array accesses and comparisons made.
